== Description

Black Flag is a project under development, a remake of a ZX Spectrum
game called
http://www.worldofspectrum.org/infoseekid.cgi?id=0002639[Jolly
Roger,role="external"], which was written by Barry Jones in 1984.

Black Flag is written in
http://forth-standard.org[Forth,role="external"] with
http://programandala.net/en.program.solo_forth.html[Solo Forth], for
ZX Spectrum 128.

Home page: http://programandala.net/en.program.black_flag.html.

== Features

Compared to the original game, Black Flag has the following (planned)
features:

- Much, much faster (no surprise, Forth inside!)
- Similar look and feel
- Improved logic
- Improved interface
- Improved plot
- Improved graphics
- Improved sound effects
- New fonts
- Trilingual
- Configurable
- And many more...

== Motivation

I find the original game very nice.  In its simplicity (it was written
in plain Sinclair BASIC in 1984), it combines features of simulation,
estrategy, text adventure and arcade.

Also a couple of little friends of mine found it very enjoyable. So,
in 2011-08 I decided to translate the original game to Spanish,
improve its interface and other details. That project was called
http://programandala.net/es.programa.bandera_negra.html[Bandera negra]
("black flag", in Spanish).  It was developed first in Sinclair BASIC
for ZX Spectrum 128, and later in MasterBASIC for its much more
powerful cousin, and considerably Spectrum-compatible,
http://worldofsam.org[SAM Coup√©, role="external"].  For technical
reasons, explained in the home page of that project, both remakes
were finally abandoned.

By the end of 2015, the development status of
http://programandala.net/en.program.solo_forth.html[Solo Forth] made
it the perfect choice to resurrect the project.  In Forth there's no
technical limitation to creativity.  Beside, the development of Black
Flag became a very useful workbench for the parallel development of
Solo Forth.

// XXX TODO --

// The game is far from finished, and the original graphics are still
// there, but here you are what it looks like at the moment (2017-02-10)
// anyway, including some nice debugging info in the sky...

== How to compile and run

. Make sure the required programs, listed in the header of the
  <Makefile> file, are installed on your system.
. Type `make` in the project directory to build the
  <disk_2_black_flag.mgt> disk image.
. Start a ZX Spectrum 128 emulator with the Plus D interface.
. Enter 128 BASIC.
. Insert the Solo Forth's <disk_0_boot.mgt> disk image into drive 1.
. Type `run` to load G+DOS and Solo Forth from drive 1.
. Insert the <disk_2_black_flag.mgt> disk image into drive 1.
. Type `1 load` to load block 1 from the current drive. This will
  start the compilation. Messages will be shown during the process.
. Set your emulator to its maximum speed and wait. When the
  compilation is finished, the screen is cleared and a message is
  displayed.
. Type `run` to start the game.
. Save a SZX snapshot with your emulator.

== Brief history

2015-11-02: Start modifying the source of the
http://programandala.net/es.programa.bandera_negra.mbim.html[abandoned
remake in MasterBASIC], in order to convert it to Forth, with the
precious help of the http://vim.org[Vim editor,role="external"].

2016-12-15: Create a local Git repository to resume the development.
Version 0.0.0: The conversion from MasterBASIC to Forth is in
progress.

2016-12-20: Version 0.1.0: The language conversion is finished.

2017-02-05: Version 0.48.0: The Git repository is uploaded to GitHub.
